This is an academic project developed in "Digital Works" where i used "Flip-Flops JK" for it.
This circuit has synchronos counter in it, the circuit need to follow a binary sequence, it has repeated numbers, so we need to add more aditional bits, it functions are:
1. The most important bits  will be the sequence numbers, and less important bits will be the orden of the numbers and repetitions.
2. We will use â€œBCD to 7 Segment Driver" in one screen will show the sequence and in the other the orden of the numbers, for example: If the number 5 is 3 times, in one screen will show the number 5 and in the other the number of the repetition.
3. Each Flip-Flop has a specific formula.
